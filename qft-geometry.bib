  title        = {Classical Chern-Simons theory, Part 1},
  abstract     = {There is a large mathematical literature on classical mechanics and field theory, especially on the relationship to symplectic geometry. One might think that the classical Chern-Simons theory, which is topological and so has vanishing hamiltonian, is completely trivial. However, this theory exhibits interesting geometry that is usually absent from ordinary field theories. (The same is true on the quantum level; topological quantum field theories exhibit geometric properties not usually seen in ordinary quantum field theories, and they lack analytic properties which are usually seen.) In this paper we carefully develop this geometry. Of particular interest are the line bundles with connection over the moduli space of flat connections on a 2-manifold. We extend the usual theory to cover 2-manifolds with boundary. We carefully develop ``gluing laws'' in all of our constructions, including the line bundle with connection over moduli space. The corresponding quantum gluing laws are fundamental. Part 1 covers connected and simply connected gauge groups; Part 2 will cover arbitrary compact Lie groups.},

We present a formula for the integral in the case where $N$ is a subsupermanifold which is appropriately non-degenerate with respect to $Q$. In the process, we discuss the linear algebra necessary to express our result in a coordinate independent way. We also extend stationary phase approximation and the Morse-Bott Lemma to supermanifolds.},

  abstract      = {Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold without boundary and let H be a self-adjoint generalized Laplace operator acting on sections in a bundle over M. We give a path integral formula for the solution to the corresponding heat equation. This is based on approximating path space by finite dimensional spaces of geodesic polygons. We also show a uniform convergence result for the heat kernels. This yields a simple and natural proof for the Hess-Schrader-Uhlenbrock estimate and a path integral formula for the trace of the heat operator.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the short-time expansion of the heat kernel of a Laplace type operator on a compact Riemannian manifold and show that the lowest order term of this expansion is given by the Fredholm determinant of the Hessian of the energy functional on a space of finite energy paths. This is the asymptotic behavior to be expected from formally expressing the heat kernel as a path integral and then (again formally) using Laplace's method on the integral. We also relate this to the zeta determinant of the Jacobi operator, which is another way to assign a determinant to the Hessian of the energy functional. We consider both the near-diagonal asymptotics as well as the behavior at the cut locus.},
